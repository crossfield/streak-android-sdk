# Streak game Android SDK

This lightweight and open-source SDK implements a best-practices PrePlay Streak game integration.

## Overview

  This code repository will help you to integration a PrePlay Streak game into your Android application.
  To use it, you must have an `app id` provided by PrePlay. If you don't have one, please get in touch at contact@preplaysports.com

  The main goal of this repository is to simplify your life with the integration of a PrePlay Streak game.
  So, to make it easy, this SDK contains an Android Activity used to host a WebView pointing to your game.
  If you want, you can use your own implementation, it's not mandotory to use this one.

  We also support the deeplinking to open your app directly to a specific page of the game.

  If you have any issue, be free to open an issue / pull request.

  The code is located on https://github.com/preplay/streak-android-sdk

## Getting Started

  - Put the `streak_sdk_android_0.1.jar` into your "libs" folder
  - Add into your manifest the INTERNET permission

        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

  - Add the activity to your manifest:

        <activity
                android:name="com.preplay.streak.PreplayStreakActivity"
                android:configChanges="keyboard|orientation|screenSize|screenLayout" />

  - Setup your game id by adding into your resources:

        <string name="preplay_streak_gameid">your_app_id</string>

  **or** from your code by calling:

        PreplayStreakActivity.setGameId("your_app_id")

  - Launch this activity from your code by calling:

        startActivity(new Intent(this, PreplayStreakActivity.class));

And that's it for the basic usage.

### Deep-linking

Your Streak game can also contains a deep-link in order to open a specific page from a website, a push notificationâ€¦

  - Modify your manifest to add the intent-filter:

        <activity
                android:name="com.preplay.streak.PreplayStreakActivity"
                android:configChanges="keyboard|orientation|screenSize|screenLayout">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW"/>
                <data android:scheme="@string/preplay_streak_scheme"/>
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>

  - Add the deep link scheme into your resources: (you can choose your 'scheme', ask your PrePlay contact for more information about how to choose one)

        <string name="preplay_streak_scheme">your_deep_link_scheme</string>

### Custom error page

If your user is not able to reach our website (due to a network error for example), you can specify your own error page.
Add into your "assets" folder, a directory called "streak" and a file "error.html". This file will be auto-load by the SDK if an error occurred.

## Test the functionalities
### Deep Linking
  You can test the deep linking thanks to [Android Debug Bridge - ADB](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html):

    adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "your_deep_link_scheme:///path_test"

## Example Usage
